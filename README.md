5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🔧 Firebase Setup

### Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read access to portfolio data for everyone
    match /{collection}/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Storage Security Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

```

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Sections
1. Update the data structure in `src/firebase/firestore.js`
2. Add the section component in `src/components/sections/`
3. Update `MainComponent.js` to render the new section
4. Add editing support in the admin panel

### Styling
- Modify `src/theme.js` for global theme changes
- Use Material-UI's `sx` prop for component-specific styling
- Tailwind classes are available for utility styling

## 🚦 Usage

### First-time Setup
1. Visit `/admin` and log in with your Firebase auth
2. The system will offer to migrate data from the JSON file
3. Edit sections through the admin panel
4. Upload media files and copy URLs for use in content

### Content Management
- **Intro Section**: Update name, title, subtitle, profile image
- **Skills**: Add/remove skills by category
- **Projects**: Manage project details, images, and videos
- **Education**: Update education history
- **Experience**: Manage work experience
- **Media**: Upload and manage all media files

## 🔐 Security

- Admin access requires Firebase authentication
- Firestore rules ensure only authenticated users can write
- Media files are publicly readable but require auth to upload
- Environment variables keep Firebase config secure

## 🚀 Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build                 # vite build + prerender (needs Chrome/Chromium)
node scripts/check-site.mjs   # fails on missing SEO tags, empty pages, JS over budget
```

`npm run build` reads the live Firestore content (public read, web API key
from `.env`) and writes, into `build/`:

- a real HTML page for every section in English (`/projects`) and Arabic
  (`/ar/projects`), each with its own title, description, canonical,
  hreflang, Open Graph and JSON-LD (`src/seo/site.js`)
- `sitemap.xml`, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, a markdown twin of every page
  (`/projects.md`, `/index.md`) and OG share images in `og/`
- WebP copies of content images in `img/` (`scripts/optimize-images.mjs`)
- `404.html` and `app.html` (the empty shell behind `/admin` and `/login`)

`npm run build:spa` skips the prerender step.

### Publishing content changes
Saved edits show to visitors immediately (the page refreshes from Firestore
after it loads). The prerendered HTML that search engines and AI agents read
is refreshed by **Publish site** in the admin panel, which calls the
`publishSite` Cloud Function → GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
→ build, check, deploy to Firebase Hosting. Pushes to `master` deploy the
same way.

One-time setup:
1. GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
   - variables: the `VITE_FIREBASE_*` values from `.env`
   - secret `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: JSON key of a service account with
     the *Firebase Hosting Admin* role
2. A fine-grained GitHub token for this repository with *Contents: read and
   write*, stored for the function: `firebase functions:secrets:set GITHUB_DISPATCH_TOKEN`
3. `firebase deploy --only functions`

### Manual deploy
```bash
npm run build && firebase deploy --only hosting
```

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
